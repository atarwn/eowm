This is my personal project, but if you want to contribute - feel free!

How to contribute
=================

### Reporting issues
Found a bug? Have an idea? Just open an issue.

### Pull requests
1. Fork it
2. Create a branch (`fix/thing` or `feat/stuff`)
3. Make your changes
4. Open a PR with clear description

No strict rules - just make sure it compiles and doesn't break everything.

Releases
========

I make releases when I feel like it. Version format: `Maj.Min`

Changelog format:
```
Maj.Min -> "Artist I was listening to while coding this release"
------
 * List of changes
 * Added XRandR for multi-monitor support
```

That's it. No extra bureaucracy.
