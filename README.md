============

This is a simple window manager, inspired by catwm and ratpoison.  
Might be used for learning purporses


Keybinds
-------

|      Keybind      | Action |

| Mod + f           | fullscreen |

Layout
------

```
 ____ ______________
|    |              |
|____|              |
|    |    Master    |
|____|              |
|    |              |
|____|______________|
```

No borders, no UI, new window pushes master to the top of the stack


Naming
------

it was very hard:
 * catwm - already exists
 * kittywm - stupid
 * meowm - two m's
 * eowm - hmm, ok

And you also stumbled upon the expanded form of the name, which I spent one brain cell on


Why?!

**Freedom**
