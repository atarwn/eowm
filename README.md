Layout

```
 ____ ______________
|    |              |
|____|              |
|    |    Master    |
|____|              |
|    |              |

borders, but still no UI, new window pushes master to the top of the stack


Naming
------

it was vewy hard:
 * catwm - origin
 * kittywm - stupid
 * meowm - two m's
 * eowm - hmm, ok

And you also stumbled upon the expanded form of the name, which I spent one brain cell on


Why?!
